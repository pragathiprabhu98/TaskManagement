# TaskManagement - It is a console based app.It is used to manage any category of your choice and the task assigned to that category.
The category in this is created has filename.And all tasks related to this is stored in this file.
We have used Model View Controller(MVC) Flavor 2 design in which there is UserInteface(UI) has first part,Control unit(CU) as second part,
Bussiness logic(BL) has thrid part,and Data Logic(DL) has fourth part.
In User interface we can only accept input and give output.UI cannot directly communicate with BL.
In  control unit will only do control flow management and data flow managemnet.
In BL it does plain old java object(POJOS).
Data logic are the files system in which all data are stored.
